# QueueUserAPC
I originally published this on Medium, which you can find at https://medium.com/@nyameeeain/queueuserapc-process-injection-6f31fcb89410.
In this demonstration of QueueUserAPC process injection, I employ two significant approaches.
The first is API obfuscation, and the second is using XOR encryption.XOR encryption is a simple method that allows me to evade basic-level detection based on signatures, while API obfuscation makes it harder to detect known API calls and tampering or reverse engineering.
